Project description: 
Not so long ago I started a small open-source project aiming to develop a program called "Loan calculator" using C# programming language. 
My primary concern was to help users compare and distinguish between different bank loans by calculating cash flows and effective interest rates 
(in case a user accepts monthly re-capilazation of her interest revenues). 
"Loan calculator" also gives a user the possibility to increase body amount of her loan (capital increase) and save obtained calculation results as reports in text format.
